Wrote in mirror: did the original change?

Answer: YES! line 1 was written in the mounted directory; line 3 was written in original directory.

checking back at the mirror, it looks like it changed aswell. 

Conclusion: anything i changed from inside both directories, reflects on the other directory as well
